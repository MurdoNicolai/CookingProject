Ingredients

    3 medium Yukon Gold potatoes (1 1/2 pounds), peeled and cut into 1/4-inch-thick rounds

    2 teaspoons salt, plus more for seasoning

    1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, divided

    1 small yellow onion, sliced into thin half-moons

    Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

    1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley, optional

Method

    Boil the potatoes:
    Place the potatoes and salt in a medium pot. Add enough water to cover by about an inch and cover tightly with a lid. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and gently simmer the potatoes, uncovered, for about 4 minutes. They should be mostly cooked through but still hold their shape well and retain a bit of resistance when pricked with a fork.
    Drain the potatoes in a colander and set aside for a few minutes to dry out a bit.

    Meanwhile, cook the onions:

    While the potatoes are coming to a boil, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring often, until theyâ€™re golden brown and slightly crispy, 12 to 14 minutes. Remove to a bowl and set aside.

    Fry the potatoes:

    Add 2 more tablespoons of oil to the skillet, raise the heat to medium-high, and carefully arrange half of the potatoes inside in a single layer (careful, they may sputter). Sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook, undisturbed, until the bottoms are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook the other side under golden brown, about 5 more minutes.

    Remove the cooked potatoes to a serving platter. Top with half of the cooked onions and half of the parsley, tent loosely with foil, and set aside.

    Cook the remaining potatoes and serve:

    Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the skillet and cook the remaining potatoes the same way. Transfer to the platter and top with the remaining onions and parsley.

    These potatoes are best served hot, straight from the skillet. Leftovers can be stored in the fridge for up to 1 day and reheated on the stove or in the microwave.
