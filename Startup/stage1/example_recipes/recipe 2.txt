A simple strata made with Hawaiian sweet bread. You can easily alter the fillings: substitute sausage for the bacon, use different cheeses, add some mushrooms, etc. Let your imagination be your guide!

Original recipe (1X) yields 8 servings

    6 Hawaiian bread rolls (such as King'sÂ®)

    Â½ cup shredded Swiss cheese, divided

    Â½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided

    3 slices cooked bacon, diced, divided

    4 green onions, diced, divided

    3 eggs

    â…” cup half-and-half

    Â½ cup skim milk

    salt and ground black pepper to taste

    2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions

    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

    Cut each roll into 8 cubes. Spread onto a baking sheet in a single layer.

    Bake in the preheated oven until toasted, about 10 minutes.

    Layer toasted bread cubes in a 1 1/2-quart baking pan. Sprinkle 1/4 cup Swiss cheese, 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese, 1/2 the bacon, and 2 green onions on top of the bread. Shake to settle the toppings into the bread.

    Beat eggs together with half-and-half, milk, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Pour over the bread cubes, pressing cubes down into the mixture. Sprinkle the remaining Swiss cheese, Cheddar cheese, bacon, green onions, and Parmesan cheese on top.

    Bake in the preheated oven until strata is hot in the center, about 30 minutes.

Cook's Note:

You can toast the bread up to 24 hours in advance.

3.26.20 Wouldnâ€™t change a thing on this, it was melt-in-your mouth luscious with perfect strata texture. Recipe doesn't say to do this, but do spray your pan/dish with cooking spray to avoid sticking. I always have Hawaiian rolls in the freezer, so although this was a quick breakfast today, I could just as easily see this as breakfast-for-dinner, as well. When putting this together, I wondered if the bread cubes were too big, but that was not the case. If anything, those big, baked, soaked bread cubes made this even more moist and tender. Thanks for sharing, this one definitely will be made again.

This was tasty, but I found it had too much bread compared to egg mixture. I think the bread portion was right, but it needs more egg/cream.

This was amazing. Make sure to spray the baking sheet prior to toasting the bread and also in the Pyrex dish before baking it. A couple of suggestions: use 8 Kings rolls, 4 Eggs, the entire package of bacon, and add havarti cheese with the same portion as the cheddar. Lastly cook it for 35 mins.

This was delicious! I added one more egg and Hawaiian roll, but kept everything else the same. It was a big hit, thanks for the recipe!

This was the best brunch casserole I have ever tasted! I used smoked sausage because my husband won't eat bacon. If I make it for others I will use bacon, but it probably won't taste any better. Thanks for the great recipe!

This WAS great! I did use a couple more slices of bacon and added 1/4c sliced, mini white mushrooms. Cooked in a 3 qt Pampered Chef baking dish - which yes! Need to Pam Spray! Recipe doesnâ€™t say whether to cook covered or uncovered - so I did uncovered and in my oven, needed an extra 5 more minutes. I took this to a Palm Sunday brunch and was well received. Forgot to snap a pic! Will make again! Thanks toastyfrenchy!
