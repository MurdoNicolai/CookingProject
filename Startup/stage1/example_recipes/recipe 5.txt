Geography: Jamaica, Caribbean

Allergens/Diet: None mentioned

Season: All seasons

Yields: 4 servings

Ingredients:

1 ½ pounds (683 grams) boneless and skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 tablespoon white vinegar
7 scallions, chopped
½ medium yellow onion, diced
3 tablespoons (20 grams) Jamaican curry powder
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons (6 grams) chopped thyme
1 tablespoon chicken bouillon
1 tablespoon minced ginger
1 teaspoon allspice
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste
1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 scotch bonnet, minced
1 large russet potato, cut into 1-inch pieces
Cooked white rice, to serve
Roti, to serve
Directions:

Toss the chicken with the vinegar, then rinse under water and pat dry.
In a large ziplock bag, combine the chicken with half of the scallions and onion, 2 tablespoons of the curry powder, 1 tablespoon of oil, half of the thyme, bouillon, ginger, allspice, black pepper, salt, garlic, and Scotch bonnet. Make sure the chicken is evenly coated. Seal the bag and refrigerate for up to 4 hours, preferably overnight.
The next day, heat the remaining oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the remaining curry powder and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Add the marinated chicken to the saucepan, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes.
Add the remaining scallions, onion, thyme, potato, and 2 cups (473 ml) water to the saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook, uncovered, until the potatoes are tender and the sauce thickens, for about 20 to 25 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the Jamaican chicken curry with rice or roti.
